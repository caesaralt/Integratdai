## 🎓 Understanding Detection Accuracy

The app now shows **confidence scores**:
- 90-100% = Excellent detection
- 75-90% = Good detection
- 60-75% = Fair detection
- Below 60% = Try better quality PDF

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Best PDF Quality**: Vector PDFs work best (created in CAD software)
2. **Clear Walls**: Dark, solid wall lines = better detection
3. **Clean Drawings**: Remove excessive text and dimensions
4. **Test First**: Try with small PDFs before large projects
5. **Update Regularly**: Run `./deploy.sh` after config changes
